I"«<p>While it has been a productive couple of months, building a new application from scratch is a lot of work! I‚Äôve never built a CRM before, so I‚Äôm still learning about the important features and letting the application guide me in understanding what it needs. I know that might sound weird, but for example, I‚Äôm working on the <strong>Profiles</strong> section right now. I have a <strong>ROLE of INSTRUCTOR</strong> that can be assigned to internal users, I have also built the <strong>Events and Scheduling</strong> sections, but now I need to assign the <strong>Events</strong> to the <strong>Instructor</strong>. So, I‚Äôm working through the flow of how to get that done. There‚Äôs the ‚Äújust get it to work‚Äù from a programming perspective, but then there‚Äôs also making sure it ‚Äúworks for the user‚Äù perspective. That‚Äôs what I mean by allowing the application to tell me what it needs.</p>

<p>One of the games I play is an Early Access game, and they just released an update along with an updated roadmap for the game. This inspired me to formally write down a roadmap for KickConnect. I had a loose set of requirements, but as the application grows in its foundation, I‚Äôm starting to realize that I can add more features much quicker now! Below is the roadmap I‚Äôm working towards. Some of these features I don‚Äôt know what they will look like yet, but they serve as placeholders for me. Some of these features will evolve into other features.</p>

<p><strong>JOB UPDATE</strong> As many of you know, I found a new job! This is great news for me personally and financially. It‚Äôs a significant job (1 month in so far), but it also requires a lot of my time. I‚Äôve been pleased with my progress in working on KickConnect during weekends and some evenings. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm burning the candle at both ends yet. If I weren‚Äôt as far along with the foundational items, I could see putting it on the back burner or having progress come a lot slower. Since I‚Äôm past the initial setup phase, I feel like progress will continue at a nice pace.  Plus I‚Äôm enjoying working on it.  It‚Äôs fun building something from scratch!</p>
