I"<p>While it has been a productive couple of months, building a new application from scratch is a lot of work! Iâ€™ve never built a CRM before, so Iâ€™m still learning about the important features and letting the application guide me in understanding what it needs. I know that might sound weird, but for example, Iâ€™m working on the <strong>Profiles</strong> section right now. I have a <strong>ROLE of INSTRUCTOR</strong> that can be assigned to internal users, I have also built the <strong>Events and Scheduling</strong> sections, but now I need to assign the <strong>Events</strong> to the <strong>Instructor</strong>. So, Iâ€™m working through the flow of how to get that done. Thereâ€™s the â€œjust get it to workâ€ from a programming perspective, but then thereâ€™s also making sure it â€œworks for the userâ€ perspective. Thatâ€™s what I mean by allowing the application to tell me what it needs.</p>
