I"{<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> My 1st job out of college was being QA! My 1st paid app as a developer was to automate my QA job! After I was done, I added what amounted to be a read.me:<br /> <strong>“I’m sorry, but this is my 1st PAID application… You should probably rewrite it!”</strong><br /> I’m told that application was around for years before being retired!</p>
