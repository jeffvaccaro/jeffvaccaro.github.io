I"<p>Many of you know, I got caught up in the layoff mania of 2024. I can tell you firsthand that the market is very different than it has been. I got laid off twice in 2001, and todayâ€™s market feels oddly similar but also very different. In 2001, all the money dried up for start-ups, and 9/11 had just happened, so there was a ton of uncertainty. For whatever reason, there is a lot of uncertainty in the market now and I canâ€™t actually put a finger on what is going on. I know companies are making money, and Iâ€™m pretty sure most companies havenâ€™t replaced devs with AI (yet). It is a very odd time, and Iâ€™m hopeful that it changes quickly.
