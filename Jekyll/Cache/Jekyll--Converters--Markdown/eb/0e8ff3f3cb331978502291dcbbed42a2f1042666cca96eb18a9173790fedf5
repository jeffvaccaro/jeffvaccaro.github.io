I"<p>My stomach dropped when I found out that I was being laid off! There was so much uncertainty, fear, and anger in that moment. I had so many things that I was thinking about and dreading about my situation. It probably took me about a week to calm down and start looking at my next steps and what I needed to do for my upcoming job hunt. The first thing I did was look at my resume. Thankfully, it was recently updated, but I knew I needed to put an end date where there wasn’t one. Then there was the LinkedIn profile tinkering. And once you are all ready to go, you flip the “Open to Work” flag, and the recruiters find you, and everyone loves you, and it’s easy to find a new gig… Well… Maybe in years past that was the case, but not this time around…. My reality was that for the first couple of weeks, it was pretty quiet.

I’m a full-stack dev, which means I float between front-end development, middle tier (API), and backend (SQL). My stack of choice is Angular with TypeScript, C#, and SQL Server. Being a full stack means you have to know quite a bit between all the different layers of an application. I don’t want to say that we are know-it-alls, but we have to know a lot. However, so much of our knowledge really is dependent on the projects that we’ve worked on. No two projects are the same, especially when you talk about legacy apps (anything built before you). So the “Jack of all trades” moniker is fairly accurate, but what I don’t like is the “Master of None” part.

However, this isn’t a Full Stack Dev vs… post. This is about the Tech Interview. It is the Full Stack Dev’s worst nightmare. I have often said the tech interview is like going to a school you know nothing about and taking a test where you don’t know the topics or the questions ahead of time. It could be broad topics, or it could be very specific topics. It could be definition-based or LeetCode tests. For me, and I think many others, it is very difficult, nerve-wracking, and a bit insulting.
