<p>It’s alive!</p>

<p>Story time… A long time ago, I thought the pinnacle of being a software developer was being a mobile developer. Microsoft had just released their new Windows Phone, and I was in LOVE with this device. All the Apple products out there made me sick. They were SO boring! And they were really just status symbols in my mind. Of course, I thought Microsoft was on to something. So, I started to develop my first app. I won’t go into all the details, but my first app was my most popular, and I still have a fondness for it even today.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years later, we all know that Microsoft pulled the plug on their Windows Phone, and that was the end of my mobile developer career. Until just a few weeks ago…</p>

<p>KickConnect needs an app to go along with the website. Some would argue that the website should really be an app; however, I disagree. User entry really needs a keyboard. It is prone to mistakes without it. But I do agree that the website needs a mobile component.</p>

<p>The following video is the beginning of that app. I did a little research, and it really came down to React Native, Ionic, and Flutter. I have serious issues with React. It’s dumb I know, but the fact is I’m never going to choose React. I chose Flutter because it wasn’t Facebook, and I’m firmly in Team Google’s camp. <strong>I know</strong> this could be another repeat of my allegiance to Microsoft years ago, but my first couple of weeks with Flutter have been really entertaining. I’m not an expert in it, but I can see why people like it!</p>

<p>My app right now is really simple. Login (using my KickConnect API), then display the user information and the classes/events already in the database (again using the API). Super simple and covers about 80% of what I’m envisioning for the public side of KickConnect. I’m sure this will grow and become more refined. I’m still learning the basics, but icons and color scheming are up next.</p>

<p>Enjoy my 1st mobile app since about 2015!</p>

        <p>**Fun Fact:** My 1st job out of college was being QA! My 1st paid app as a developer was to automate my QA job! After I was done, I added what amounted to be a read.me: **&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but this is my 1st PAID application... You should probably rewrite it!&quot;**
I&#39;m told that application was around for years before finally being retired!
