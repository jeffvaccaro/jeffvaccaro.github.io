    <p>As you may have heard… I was laid off in 2024. I’m kidding, not because it isn’t true, but because I was very loud about it! Getting laid off was not on my 2024 bingo card. When it first happened, as you know, I went through a wide range of emotions. Now that life has settled down for the moment, I have some time to reflect on 2024.</p>

<p>It was exactly one year ago today that I created my first <strong>React</strong> application in hopes of preparing for the new direction that my former company was going. I was pretty stoked about it! I didn’t realize what the infant 2024 had in store for me at that time, but it started a chain reaction of things that I was not expecting.</p>

<p>Creating the React application for me was the easy part! I found the challenge to be hosting it on <strong>AWS</strong>. After going through that entire process of learning how to actually use AWS as a customer, something happened that was very powerful. AWS was no longer a product that I feared or was overwhelmed by; it was no longer an unknown to me. Sure, I had used certain services from AWS that other companies needed, but everything was scripted out and handed to me. But now, hosting something on my own, I had to learn: <strong>IAM permissions, security groups, inbound/outbound rules, RDS Instances, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda functions</strong>, and many other services that AWS offers. I had wrangled AWS, and I had an application that was now hosted on AWS. This knowledge would become very useful in 2024, and I had #confidence that I didn’t know I needed.</p>

<p>From that small React application, another unexpected result occurred…</p>

<p>When I was a younger developer, I would stay up all hours of the night and just code. It didn’t matter if it was right after work, late at night, or during the weekends. I created what I thought were masterpieces! These were passion projects for me, and I loved doing them. In my life, I have written two websites and six mobile apps. Then one day in the mid-2000s, I just stopped coding for fun. My creative light had been blown out. I didn’t know why; I had several apps that I was close to finishing at the time, but I could never regain the passion to finish them. On 12/31/2023, that changed.</p>

<p><strong>Fast forward to today!</strong> “When one door closes, another one opens.” I heard that a lot in September/October. Looking back to that time, I found that I enjoyed writing these blog posts for everyone to read. If you’ve never done it, it is a crazy experience. For me, I felt like I was saying the quiet parts out loud, and that is incredibly scary but also thrilling at the same time. I enjoyed the creative process of writing the posts. Something else that grounded me during that time was finding a new passion project. <strong>KickConnect</strong> - When I started writing that application, it was an <i>“I could probably do it better than this…”</i> type of project. I had no idea what it was going to do, but now three to four months later, I have written and tested a lot of code for this application. Although I’m not done yet with it, I’m still working on it, making a lot of progress and getting closer to a v1 release.</p>

<p>I owe that little React app a great deal of thanks. <strong>It gave me confidence, and it reignited my creative flame</strong>.</p>

<p>Today, I am right where I’m supposed to be. I’m at a new company, in a new position. There are challenges that I’ve never faced before, but I wake up every day excited to try to solve those issues. I work with people that I learn from on a daily basis, and I feel honored and grateful to be where I’m at. I am enjoying the process of building something new and exciting but from a totally different perspective than where I’ve spent the majority of my career.</p>

<p>On 1/1/24, there was a certain level of uncertainty and some fear. On 1/1/25, there is still uncertainty (of course), but no fear and that is huge difference!</p>

<p>Happy 2025!</p>

        <p>**Fun Fact:** My 1st job out of college was being QA! My 1st paid app as a developer was to automate my QA job! After I was done, I added what amounted to be a read.me: **&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but this is my 1st PAID application... You should probably rewrite it!&quot;**
I&#39;m told that application was around for years before finally being retired!
