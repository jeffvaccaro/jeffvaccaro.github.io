  <div class="post-content">
    <p>It’s amazing how time flies!  I have 25 years of development experience.  I started in VB4 and now I’m doing Full Stack Development in React/Node/Express!  I’ve seen the good times in this field and the not-so-good times.  But overall I’m still here learning!  I have a passion for technology and coding, but now I really want to branch out into how I can help devs be successful.  Yes, I would like to be a tech dev manager someday!  But in the mean time I’m always looking to mentor people and help my team mates become better devs.<br /></p>

<p>I’m currently working in Angular/Typescript with a C# webAPI and SQL Server database.  I’ve dabbled in React with Node/Express as the API, although I’m focusing on Angular right now.  When it comes to coding, the more things change the more things are the same.  Back in the day, learning a new language would take weeks (if not months), now things are getting a lot easier!  Although I work just as hard as I did when I was a new dev, the information and examples have just gotten SO MUCH BETTER!  My most recent experience is with learning React by consuming a 9 hour YouTube video and creating a simple SPA hosted on AWS in just under a week!  <br /></p>

<p>Fun Fact: My 1st job out of college was being QA!  I had a lot of good mentors back then.  But one manager took me under his wing and allowed me to become the dev that I was meant to be.  He bought me VB books and allowed me to write my 1st <b>PAID</b> application!  My goal of that application was to make my QA job easier and ultimately that tool eliminated that position altogether!  My comment that I wrote for that application was something like: “I’m sorry, but this is my 1st real application…  Please update it!”.</p>

<p>I’ve worked in the following technologies over the years:
C#, SQL, JS, TS, Angular, Vue, React, WPF, ASP.Net, PHP</p>

<p>I’m currently working on <a href="http://kickconnect-env-1.eba-bsj8msyj.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/">KickConnect</a> - A Customer Relationship Management tool for Marital Art Studios and beyond!  This is built using Angular (using TypeScript), Node/ExpressJS and MySQL currently hosted on AWS!</p>

<p>Another side project I’ve done is <a href="http://resumeappv1.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/">Contractor:25</a> - This was the beginning of my React and AWS journey!</p>

<p>Here is my current resume: <a href="https://github.com/jeffvaccaro/jeffvaccaro/blob/main/vaccaro_resume2024.pdf">vaccaro_resume2024</a> <br /><br />
