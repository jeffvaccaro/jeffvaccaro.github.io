<p>I‚Äôve blogged before, so welcome back!  But if you‚Äôre new here, let me introduce myself. My name is Jeff, I‚Äôve been a Full Stack Developer since the very beginning of my career.  I‚Äôm proud of this and to be honest I wear it as a badge of honor.  It‚Äôs never been an <i>easy</i> career, but I relish the feeling of figuring something out that I‚Äôve never done before!  Most of my career has been as a Microsoft developer.  I started out as a VB4 dev and ASP, I have fond memories of the browser wars and the dot com BOOM(&amp; BUST)!  Since the early 2000‚Äôs I adopted .NET and C#.  I‚Äôve dabbled in .php and I was a PROUD Windows Phone developer (I‚Äôm still sad/<span style="color: red;">angry</span> it wasn‚Äôt more popular).  Since my Windows Phone days, I‚Äôve done WPF, ASP.NET, webAPI (all w/C# as my language of choice) and my front end of choice is Angular w/typeScript although I‚Äôve dabbled with Vue.js and React as well.<br />
<br />
My current passion project is something I call <a href="http://kickconnect-env-1.eba-bsj8msyj.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/" target="_blank">KickConnect!</a>  It is a Customer Management Relationship tool for Martial Art studios.  I‚Äôm building that in Angular, Node/ExpressJS with a MySQL database.</p>

<h4 id="this-will-be-my-main-platform-for-kickconnect-updates">This will be my main platform for <b>KickConnect</b> updates:</h4>
<p>I will share the latest updates and insights on KickConnect. I‚Äôll be sharing successes, failures and everything in-between!</p>

<h4 id="continuing-the-beyond-the-code-posts">Continuing the ‚Äú<b>Beyond the Code:</b>‚Äù posts</h4>
<p>I‚Äôm going to continue to go beyond just the technical aspects of programming and explore the human side of technology.  It will be my story of the current state of tech.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this, I hope you have a great day!  I‚Äôm glad to have a place to share my journey!</p>
