<h3 id="why-not-react">Why NOT React?</h3>
<p>At work, people often ask me what architecture I prefer. I always respond Angular - then I get a side-eye, and usually, people roll their eyes.</p>

<p>I know that React is all the rage right now. I remember when Angular was all the rage. Folks, it’s just another framework! The difference I’ve seen is that Angular is opinionated, and to be perfectly honest, I like that. I messed around with React, and there was zero structure. You have to be very careful to craft your projects consistently; otherwise, you wind up with a giant mess.</p>

<p>When I started with KickConnect, I knew that I didn’t want to spend a ton of time in CSS hell with image creation, pixel sizing, and SCSS vs. CSS, not to mention CSS Grid vs Flexbox etc. I wanted and needed a pre-built UI. At first, I thought I would do it in React to add it to my resume. I purchased my UI and then dove right in - Holy HELL! I’ve been frustrated in my life before, but I have not been that lost in a project in a VERY LONG TIME! I tinkered and tinkered with the UI codebase for many days (at least a week plus!) until I said, “eff it, I’m going to Angular”.</p>

<p>As you know, I’ve spent the last 5+ years in Angular, so when I found a new UI in Angular, I was writing code within a day! I know I’m familiar with Angular, so that is the main reason for the quickness. I know there can be a certain amount of garbage in any project, but if you do it right, everything is laid out very nicely, and your application is really easy to understand in Angular.</p>

<p>There may be some great things that React does better than Angular. I just saw the nested upon nested files, and the red flags were raised. To be fair, I really did try with React. I looked at the pros and cons, and honestly, I didn’t see much of a difference. So after the UI debacle, it was a no-brainer for me.</p>

<p><strong><em>Further Thoughts on Angular vs React:</em></strong></p>

<p><b>Scalability:</b> Angular’s structure makes it easier to scale larger applications with a consistent coding standard. React, being a library, offers more flexibility, but this can lead to inconsistencies in larger projects.</p>

<p><b>Performance:</b>  React’s virtual DOM can offer performance benefits in certain scenarios, but Angular’s two-way data binding can simplify complex forms and data interactions.</p>

<p><b>Community and Support:</b> Both Angular and React have strong communities, but Angular’s full framework offers more built-in support for common scenarios like routing and form handling, whereas React relies on third-party libraries.</p>

<h3 id="flutter-over-react-native">Flutter over React Native</h3>
<p>I know neither currently, but I guess I’m team Google! I went with Flutter, and so far, it is pretty nice. I will say that setting up Flutter because of Java was dumb and could be made a boatload easier, but after everything was installed correctly, it does work pretty nice!</p>

<p><strong><em>Further Thoughts on Flutter vs React Native:</em></strong></p>

<p><b>Performance:</b> Flutter’s use of the Skia graphics engine allows for smooth animations and graphics, often resulting in better performance compared to React Native, which relies on a JavaScript bridge to interact with native components.</p>

<p><b>Development Speed:</b> Flutter’s hot reload feature is a game-changer, allowing developers to see changes instantly. React Native also offers a similar feature, but many developers find Flutter’s implementation more seamless.</p>

<p><b>UI Consistency:</b> Flutter provides a single codebase with consistent UI across both iOS and Android. React Native allows for platform-specific code, which can lead to inconsistencies in the user experience.</p>

<p><b>Ecosystem:</b> While React Native has been around longer and has a more mature ecosystem, Flutter’s ecosystem is rapidly growing with strong support from Google and a passionate community.</p>

<p>There will be more to come on Flutter in the future. Right now, I’ve written one page in it. There will be more on that later!</p>

        <p>**Fun Fact:** My 1st job out of college was being QA! My 1st paid app as a developer was to automate my QA job! After I was done, I added what amounted to be a read.me: **&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but this is my 1st PAID application... You should probably rewrite it!&quot;**
I&#39;m told that application was around for years before finally being retired!
