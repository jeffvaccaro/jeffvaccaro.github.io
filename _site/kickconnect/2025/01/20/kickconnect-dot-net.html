    <p><strong>KickConnect</strong> is finally official!  I purchased the domain name <a href="www.kickconnect.net">kickConnect.NET</a>!  The .com was not available unfortunately, but I will be keeping an eye out for it.</p>

<p>Getting it to resolve with ElasticBeanstalk was more difficult than I would have liked it to be, but that is the story of my life with anything AWS. <i>When is a cloud provider going to make an easy button for this stuff?</i> But alas, I figured it out and the site is up.</p>

<p>Now if you go there, all you will see is the <i>login screen</i>.  Big whoop, right?  I have to figure out how I want the public facing application to function. As eventually it will be where I host demos and allow gym/martial art studios to visit.  My plan is to make it by invitation only!  I was thinking of doing either screenshots or make a YouTube video showcasing the new features and functionality of it.  I’d be interested to hear other suggestions.  I just don’t want a bunch of people adding stuff that I will eventually have to clean up.</p>

<p>I was looking at the road map from Nov 11th and I wanted to see the progress that I’ve made (hopefully):</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-road-map-11112024">What’s the Road map (11/11/2024)…</h3>
<ul>
  <li><del>Profiles</del> <strong>DONE!</strong></li>
  <li><del>Class Assignments</del> <strong>DONE!</strong></li>
  <li>HTML-Template Customization -&gt; <strong><em>WORK IN PROGRESS</em></strong></li>
  <li>Component Management
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to turn on and off components for users</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Member Portal</li>
  <li>Member Tables and Date Input</li>
  <li>Importing existing data</li>
  <li>Phone Apps</li>
  <li>Communication ability</li>
  <li>
    <p>Shopify</p>
  </li>
  <li>AWS Architecture
    <ul>
      <li>Lambdas</li>
      <li>API Gateway</li>
      <li>Containers</li>
      <li>Deployments</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m pleased that the <strong>Profiles</strong> and the ability to <strong>Assign classes/events</strong> to Coaches is complete!  In some ways it was easier than I thought, because I was able to share code and use the framework already built for the <strong>Scheduling of classes/events</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>HTML Template Customization tool</strong> is a lot more complicated than I thought it would be.  Not only is there a lot of functionality that I’m building into it, but making it UI friendly is very important to me.  What’s the point of having a wiz-bang utility if it is super complicated to use resulting in less use?  That is taking some time to figure out…  But I am making some good progress.  This weekend I spent a bit of time making the code base a little easier to read and I was able to add some functionality as well.  More to come on that!</p>

<p>As I wrap up the next feature on the list I’m trying to figure out the next <b>feature</b> to work on.  I really want to start the Member portal, but I want to make sure that I have everything I need for the Admin side 1st. Is it the Admin <b>Component Management</b> or is it the <b>Shopify</b> integration? The fact of the matter is, once this goes live and I have customers it will get difficult to add new features as I will be fixing bugs and getting a list of enhancements as well.</p>

<p>I don’t really have too much more to add in the roadmap for right now.  My progress has slowed as I have a full time job, that I’m really enjoying.  But I am continuing to enjoy working on the application.  I’m really looking forward to starting <b><i>what ever is next</i></b>.</p>

<p>More to come!</p>
