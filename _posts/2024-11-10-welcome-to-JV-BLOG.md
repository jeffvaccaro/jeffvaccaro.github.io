## Welcome to the J:\V BLOG

I've blogged before, so welcome back!  But if you're new here, let me introduce myself. My name is Jeff, I've been a Full Stack Developer since the very beginning of my career.  I'm proud of this and to be honest I wear it as a badge of honor.  It's never been an <i>easy</i>, but I relish the feeling of figuring something out that I've never done before!  Most of my career has been as a Microsoft developer.  I started out as a VB4 dev and ASP, I have fond memories of the browser wars and the dot com BOOM & BUST!  Since the early 2000's I adopted .NET and C#.  I've dabbled in .php and I was a PROUD Windows Phone developer (I'm still sad/<span style="color: red;">angry</span> it wasn't more popular).  Since my Windows Phone days, I've done WPF, ASP.NET, webAPI (all w/C# as my language of choice) and my front end of choice is Angular w/typeScript although I've dabbled with Vue.js and React as well.  My current passion project is something I call KickConnect!  It is a Customer Management Relationship tool for Martial Art studios.  I'm building that in Angular, Node/ExpressJS with a MySQL database.  

### What to Expect

#### KickConnect Updates
Join me as I share the latest updates and insights on KickConnect. I'll be sharing successes, failures and everything in-between!

#### Beyond the Code
I'll also be continuing my "Beyond the Code" series from LinkedIn, this segment goes beyond the technical aspects of programming to explore the human side of technology. From career advice to personal growth in the tech industry, discover how to navigate and thrive in your tech journey.

Thank you for reading this, I hope you have a great day!  I'm glad to have a place to share my journey!
