## Welcome to the J:\V BLOG

I've blogged before, so welcome back!  But if you're new here, let me introduce myself. My name is Jeff, I've been a Full Stack Developer since the very beginning of my career.  I'm proud of this and to be honest I wear it as a badge of honor.  It's never been an <i>easy</i> career, but I relish the feeling of figuring something out that I've never done before!  Most of my career has been as a Microsoft developer.  I started out as a VB4 dev and ASP, I have fond memories of the browser wars and the dot com BOOM(& BUST)!  Since the early 2000's I adopted .NET and C#.  I've dabbled in .php and I was a PROUD Windows Phone developer (I'm still sad/<span style="color: red;">angry</span> it wasn't more popular).  Since my Windows Phone days, I've done WPF, ASP.NET, webAPI (all w/C# as my language of choice) and my front end of choice is Angular w/typeScript although I've dabbled with Vue.js and React as well.

My current passion project is something I call <a href="http://kickconnect-env-1.eba-bsj8msyj.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/" target="_blank">KickConnect!</a>  It is a Customer Management Relationship tool for Martial Art studios.  I'm building that in Angular, Node/ExpressJS with a MySQL database.  


#### This will be my main platform for <b>KickConnect</b> updates:
I will share the latest updates and insights on KickConnect. I'll be sharing successes, failures and everything in-between!

#### Continuing the "<b>Beyond the Code:</b>" posts
I'm going to continue to go beyond just the technical aspects of programming and explore the human side of technology.  It will be my story of the current state of tech.

Thank you for reading this, I hope you have a great day!  I'm glad to have a place to share my journey!
