**KickConnect** is finally official!  I purchased the domain name <a href="www.kickconnect.net">kickConnect.NET</a>!  The .com was not available unfortunately, but I will be keeping an eye out for it.  

Getting it to resolve with ElasticBeanstalk was more difficult than I would have liked it to be, but that is the story of my life with anything AWS. <i>When is a cloud provider going to make an easy button for this stuff?</i> But alas, I figured it out and the site is up.

Now if you go there, all you will see is the <i>login screen</i>.  Big whoop, right?  I have to figure out how I want the public facing application to function. As eventually it will be where I host demos and allow gym/martial art studios to visit.  My plan is to make it by invitation only!  I was thinking of doing either screenshots or make a YouTube video showcasing the new features and functionality of it.  I'd be interested to hear other suggestions.  I just don't want a bunch of people adding stuff that I will eventually have to clean up.

I was looking at the road map from Nov 11th and I wanted to see the progress that I've made (hopefully):

### What's the Road map (11/11/2024)...
- ~~Profiles~~ **DONE!**
- ~~Class Assignments~~ **DONE!**
- HTML-Template Customization -> ***WORK IN PROGRESS***
- Component Management
    - Ability to turn on and off components for users
- Member Portal
- Member Tables and Date Input
- Importing existing data 
- Phone Apps
- Communication ability
- Shopify

- AWS Architecture
    - Lambdas
    - API Gateway
    - Containers
    - Deployments

I'm pleased that the **Profiles** and the ability to **Assign classes/events** to Coaches is complete!  In some ways it was easier than I thought, because I was able to share code and use the framework already built for the **Scheduling of classes/events**.

The **HTML Template Customization tool** is a lot more complicated than I thought it would be.  Not only is there a lot of functionality that I'm building into it, but making it UI friendly is very important to me.  What's the point of having a wiz-bang utility if it is super complicated to use resulting in less use?  That is taking some time to figure out...  But I am making some good progress.  This weekend I spent a bit of time making the code base a little easier to read and I was able to add some functionality as well.  More to come on that!

As I wrap up the next feature on the list I'm trying to figure out the next <b>feature</b> to work on.  I really want to start the Member portal, but I want to make sure that I have everything I need for the Admin side 1st. Is it the Admin <b>Component Management</b> or is it the <b>Shopify</b> integration? The fact of the matter is, once this goes live and I have customers it will get difficult to add new features as I will be fixing bugs and getting a list of enhancements as well.

I don't really have too much more to add in the roadmap for right now.  My progress has slowed as I have a full time job, that I'm really enjoying.  But I am continuing to enjoy working on the application.  I'm really looking forward to starting <b><i>what ever is next</i></b>.  

More to come!
