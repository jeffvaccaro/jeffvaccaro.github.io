While it has been a productive couple of months, building a new application from scratch is a lot of work! I’ve never built a CRM before, so I’m still learning about the important features and letting the application guide me in understanding what it needs. I know that might sound weird, but for example, I’m working on the **Profiles** section right now. I have a **ROLE of INSTRUCTOR** that can be assigned to internal users, I have also built the **Events and Scheduling** sections, but now I need to assign the **Events** to the **Instructor**. So, I’m working through the flow of how to get that done. There’s the "just get it to work" from a programming perspective, but then there’s also making sure it "works for the user" perspective. That’s what I mean by allowing the application to tell me what it needs.

One of the games I play is an Early Access game, and they just released an update along with an updated roadmap for the game. This inspired me to formally write down a roadmap for KickConnect. I had a loose set of requirements, but as the application grows in its foundation, I’m starting to realize that I can add more features much quicker now! Below is the roadmap I’m working towards. Some of these features I don’t know what they will look like yet, but they serve as placeholders for me. Some of these features will evolve into other features.

**JOB UPDATE** As many of you know, I found a new job! This is great news for me personally and financially. It’s a significant job (1 month in so far), but it also requires a lot of my time. I’ve been pleased with my progress in working on KickConnect during weekends and some evenings. I don’t feel like I’m burning the candle at both ends yet. If I weren’t as far along with the foundational items, I could see putting it on the back burner or having progress come a lot slower. Since I’m past the initial setup phase, I feel like progress will continue at a nice pace.  Plus I'm enjoying working on it.  It's fun building something from scratch!
